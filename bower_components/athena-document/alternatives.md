# Markdown Alternatives

There are 3 different markdown components that look promising

## marked-element

[marked-element](https://github.com/Polymer/marked-element) was created asa part of the Polymer elements and was the first markdown parsing element that I saw. It looks promising except for one thing: I haven't figured out how to use highlight.js with it. This renders the tool less than ideal for the kind of writing I want to do. 

## re-markable

[re-markable](https://github.com/aktowns/polymer-re-markable)

## juicy-markdown

[juicy-markdown](https://github.com/Juicy/juicy-markdown) presents the best selection of markdown elements. It allows you to use Github Flavored Markdown but it forces you to use the download of a scrapped version of the Github CSS file. This doesn't always work. 

## Others

[webcomponents.info](http://webcomponents.info/) has a selection of Markdown viewer and editor components. re-markable and juicy-markdown were selected from that list.
